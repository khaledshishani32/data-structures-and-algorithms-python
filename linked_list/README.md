## Singly Linked List
*
A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.
## Description of the challenge
Insert nodes into linked list
search the node and print the linked list
## Approach & Efficiency
Approach & Efficiency was choosen to be big O for time and space:
insert: time O(1) space O(1)
includes: time O(n) space O(1)
## API
insert: Adds a node of a value to the head of LL
include: Return T/F if value is in the linked list or not
